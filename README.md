# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Task description
You need to write an ajax-invitation to the server, get a response to the json-array with information about the files in the folders (name, size, time of creation and modification), display in the icon window, as in the operating system.
Adapt the viewing under the phone and laptop, add a sort sort switch to the list of files by name, size, creation date.
Save the selected sort as conditional sort in cookies.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
